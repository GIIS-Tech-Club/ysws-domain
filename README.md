# Welcome to the You Ship, We Ship Initiative! üöÄ

Create and publish your own website, and we'll gift you a custom domain for free! Whether you're a passionate coder or a curious beginner, this is your chance to shine. Follow these steps to upload your website to GitHub and get started. Before we begin, **be sure to star ‚≠ê the repo**! 

## Why Participate?

Creating a unique website helps you:

- **Express Creativity**: Showcase your unique ideas and design skills.
- **Learn Web Development**: Gain hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or any frontend and backend you want!

We understand finances might be a barrier to setup your own website and we don't want that, so, we will pay for your domain!
