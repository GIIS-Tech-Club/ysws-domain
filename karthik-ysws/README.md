# Portfolio Website - Karthik

Hello, everyone! This is a basic template for a portfolio website which, in my opinion, is wonderful! Below are some screenshots for the website:

I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make this, however, currently there is no backend server due to no need for it. However, in the future, I plan on adding backend features such as custom chats, etc.


The domain I want is karthik.codes (or something better which you can think of) which is $4.61 for the first year!
